# Smart Power Monitor

Spring Boot based Microservices application to track home power usages and send email alerts to users on their device energy usages

The system accepts energy readings from devices, processes them asynchronously, stores time-series metrics, raises alerts when usage spikes, and exposes a unified API through an API Gateway with resilience, security, and observability built in.

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Java **26**  
- **Framework:** **Spring Boot 4.1** (domain services and gateway);  **Spring AI** (`insight-service`)  
- **Spring Cloud:** **2025.1.0** — Gateway (Server WebMVC), **Circuit Breaker** (Resilience4j)  
- **Messaging:** **Apache Kafka** (KRaft)  
- **Databases:** **MySQL 8** (relational data), **InfluxDB 2** (time-series usage)  
- **Identity (local dev):** **Keycloak**  
- **Email (local dev):** **Mailpit**  
- **Observability:** **Micrometer**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**  
- **API documentation:** **springdoc-openapi** (gateway aggregates service OpenAPI URLs)  
- **Containerization:** **Docker** & **Docker Compose**  
- **Build:** **Maven** (each service includes `mvnw`)

## Architecture overview

The system is a **microservices architecture** built primarily with **Spring Boot 4.1** and **Java 26**. Services are independently deployable modules; integration uses **synchronous HTTP** (client → gateway → service) and **asynchronous messaging** (Kafka) where loose coupling and scale matter.

**Patterns and capabilities:**

| Area | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **API Gateway** | Spring Cloud Gateway (Server MVC); single public HTTP façade, route aggregation, OpenAPI aggregation |
| **Service communication** | REST between gateway and backends; Kafka for ingestion → usage → alerts |
| **Resilience** | **Circuit breakers** (Resilience4j) on gateway routes with fallbacks |
| **Security** | **OAuth2 Resource Server** on the gateway; **Keycloak** for identity (dev profile in Docker Compose) |
| **Observability** | Spring Boot **Actuator**, **Micrometer**, **Prometheus** scrape targets, **Grafana** dashboards |
| **Configuration** | Per-service `application.properties` (no separate Spring Cloud Config Server in this repo) |

**High-level interaction:** Clients call the **API Gateway**. Domain services (**user**, **device**, **telemetry**, **insight**) sit behind it. **Telemetry** publishes to Kafka; **usage** consumes, writes to **InfluxDB**, and may publish **alerts**; **alert** consumes alerts and sends email (e.g. via **Mailpit** in local dev). **Insight** can provide AI-style summaries (Spring AI), routed through the gateway when enabled.

## Services breakdown

| Service | Port | Responsibility | Key technologies | Interactions |
|---------|------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **api-gateway** | `9000` | Public entry: routing, circuit breaking, JWT validation, aggregated API docs | Spring Boot 4.1, Spring Cloud Gateway (WebMVC), Resilience4j, OAuth2 Resource Server, springdoc | Proxies to user, device, ingestion, insight services; calls Keycloak JWKS |
| **user-service** | `8080` | User accounts and related persistence | Spring Boot 4.1, JPA, MySQL, Flyway, Actuator/Prometheus | MySQL; invoked via gateway |
| **device-service** | `8081` | Device registry / metadata | Spring Boot 4.1, JPA, MySQL, Actuator/Prometheus | MySQL; invoked via gateway |
| **telemetry-service** | `8082` | Accept energy readings over HTTP and publish to streaming pipeline | Spring Boot 4.1, Kafka producer, Actuator/Prometheus | Produces to Kafka (`energy-usage`); invoked via gateway or directly for tests |
| **usage-service** | `8083` | Consume usage events, time-series storage, aggregation / threshold logic | Spring Boot 4.1, Kafka consumer/producer, InfluxDB Java client, Actuator/Prometheus | Kafka ↔ InfluxDB; produces alert events for downstream consumers |
| **alert-service** | `8084` | Consume alert events, notify users (e.g. email) | Spring Boot 4.1, Kafka, JPA, Mail, MySQL, Actuator/Prometheus | Kafka consumer; SMTP (Mailpit locally); MySQL where applicable |
| **insight-service** | `8085` | Usage insights (e.g. LLM-backed explanations via Ollama) | Spring Boot 4.1, Spring AI, Ollama starter, Actuator/Prometheus | Invoked via gateway; optional external Ollama runtime |
